# Vinylshop
What is this? A small e-commerce website, that sells random products created with the faker api.


We integrated payment via swype, so if anyone wants to buy or silly products they can.

Email is also integrated, buyers get emails as their orders change status


## In Development
Plans are to make it so that there are actual products on this page. Vinylshop will sell 'vinyls' of the most popular music at the time.

This will be done by using the last.fm api. Keep checking back for more!
