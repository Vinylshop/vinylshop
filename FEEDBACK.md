* I really like the code quality that I'm seeing so far. Well done to write consistent code - this is a major challenge!

* Looks like the tests are coming along! Tests are important, but I don't want you to feel like you have to overdo it. My goal here is to get you used to writing tests and start to get a feeler for what kinds of tests are useful. Ideally, I would like to see something like this:
    - At least one test per API route
    - At least one test per instance method/class method/getter/setter/validation on each model (don't bother with the user model though - just the code you've written)
    - That being said, I don't want you to spend more than half a day on writing your server tests at this point, so even if you don't quite get there at the end of that period, I'll be happy
    - Something that's NOT an effective test is to check and make sure that the data values are set correctly after creating. That's Sequelize's responsibility to test that. See: https://learn.fullstackacademy.com/workshop/589f3d5b12f93c00045c27fd/content/58ff53739596000004bbed2a/text

* Start thinking about access control - who should be able to get all the orders? Can logged in users get their own orders?



Discussion questions:
- How has group work been so far? Is there anything that's working well? Anything that needs to change?
- How is your project management?
- A seed script would come in handy soon - do you have plans to make one?
- What are your plans for the cart?
- How are you going to start with the front-end?
